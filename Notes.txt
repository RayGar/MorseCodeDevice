How it's going to work:
User can push or press the button to send a morse character. These characters will be stored in an array or list andonce they are able to completean output character 
(a character from A to Z or a digit) then that output character will be printed in the second row. How do we know when the morse characters have are able to be translated to 
a morse character? Either when the maximum number of morse characters has been reached (5) or when 5 seconds have passed and the user has not added any morse characters.

Assumption: if the user does not put a valid morse code character combination, then we may print a space or discard it some other way.


Later on, for sending data I will do something similar, when 10secondshave passed and the user has created at least 1 valid output character, then that's when I will send the character
to the server, where it will be displayed in a website.

Technical details: I will keep the output characters in an array, preferabbly an assoiciative array.

I will also keep an integer variable for the columns in the second row. This is becuase I will be going back and forth between the first and second columnfor printing characters
and I will want to keep track of which column I left off in between subsequent prints.
